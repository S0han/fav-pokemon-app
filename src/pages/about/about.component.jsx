            Hi my name is Kane Pereira.

            I enjoy trying out new web development features and frameworks.
             
            I built this purely as aportfolio app to test out my skills with Reactjs and Firebase.

        <h2>
            This app will let you search and store your favourite pokemon. 
            
            If you log out and log in at another time it will display your saved pokemon. 

            You would like to reset hit delete to then search/store a new pokemon.
